### This is not production code. 

It is me learning R, R Packaging, and playing with algorithms. Not recommended for your use!

One of the collections is a ChunkedList Class. After reading various online forums about how slow R lists are and that people use chunking to mitigate this, I wrote this class. Microbenchmarking this indicates that the built-in list is several orders magnitude faster than my class :(
